Predict degradation rates using a bi-directional GRU Network

Dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-covid-vaccine)

## Project structure

The project has the following structure:
- `notebook/`: `.ipynb` Colab-friendly notebook with model training
- `input/`: input data
- `output/`: model exported from the notebook

## Working with the repo

### Environment

To work with the repo, I recommend creating a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### Reproducing solution

The solution can be reproduced by running the Jupyter notebook
